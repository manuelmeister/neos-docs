# Neos Dev Docs Improvements
**This is a work in progress.**

This should be viewed as a suggestion of how the documentation could look like and how it should be structured to be more accessible for beginners and also advanced users.

Some content has already been added to the documentation. Sometimes it's just a placeholder or a description what should be the content for the section.

This proposal is not made with Neos or directly changed in the docs so as not to limit / distract me from the current capabilities of Neos. This [vitepress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/) project just converts some Markdown files to HTML. Navigation and sidebar are configured inside `.vitepress/config.ts`.
