# Contributing

Regardless of whether you are a frontend or backend developer, whether you're an integrator or in marketing – we invite you to contribute to Neos. 

For a low-level entry into our community, we want to encourage you to report bugs on our Github projects. If you're a developer, go ahead and fix them and submit your pull requests to one of the repositories.

If you're not a coder, that doesn't mean you don't have great value for Neos. You can, for instance, help us enrich the documentation. Just get in touch with us and we'll show you the ropes!
