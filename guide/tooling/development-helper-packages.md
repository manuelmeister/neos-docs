# Debug Helpers

On this page, we list various packages which help with debugging and profiling a Neos/Flow installation.

## [Content Repository Debugger](https://github.com/Sebobo/Shel.ContentRepository.Debugger)

This package by Sebastian Helzle allows to output the Node Types of your Neos CMS project as various types of graphs via a backend module.
