# Extending the Content User Interface

## Our current Neos UI

The administration area (Neos CMS UI) is written in ReactJS with Immutable data structures. It allows you to extend and modify every aspect of the interface.

## Our legacy Ember UI

If you are maintaining websites written before 2019, you might still use our legacy Ember UI. (Our first stable ReactJS UI was released in December 2017).
