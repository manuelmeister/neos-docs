Node Migrations are a way to programmatically mass-update the Nodes you have in Neos. This is needed when you want to rename NodeTypes, adjust property names or update Content Dimensions.

## The core idea

Node migrations are defined in YAML files, residing in the _Migrations/ContentRepository/_ folder of a package.

A migration must have an _up_ part (for migrating "upwards"), and it can have a _down_ part for reverting the migration (if possible).

Each Node migration consists of two steps:

1.  a set of **filters** which determine when a node should be transformed. Only if a node matches all filters, it is transformed.
2.  a list of **transformations** to update the filtered nodes.

## Running a migration

You can list all migrations in all packages using the _./flow node:migrationstatus_ command:

```bash
$ ./flow node:migrationstatus

  Rename from Neos.NeosDemoTypo3Org to Neos.Demo

Successfully applied migration.

## Adding a Content Dimension

One of the most common cases to run a node migration is when you have created your website without dimensions first, and lateron want to introduce e.g. a _language_ dimension. In this case, the existing content (which has no dimension information attached) needs to be moved to the default of the dimension; otherwise it just disappears because it is not reachable anymore.

As an example, let's say we have started our website without dimensions, and then we add the following dimension configuration:

Configuration/Settings.yaml:
```yaml
Neos:
  ContentRepository:
    contentDimensions:
      language:
        label: 'Language'
		# the following line determines the default language
        default: en_US
        defaultPreset: en_US
        presets:
          en_US:
            label: 'English (US)'
            values:
              - en_US
            uriSegment: en
          de:
            label: German
            values:
              - de
            uriSegment: de

```

With the above configuration, our complete website has no visible content anymore, as the content in the system is not yet moved to the _language_ dimension.

This can be done with a node migration which is included in the Neos.ContentRepository package:

```bash
./flow node:migrate 20150716212459
```

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Needs to be run whenever you add new dimensions**
> 
> This migration has to be applied whenever a new dimension is configured to set the default value on all existing nodes.

Now, every content in the system is moved to _language en\_US_, because this is the dimension's _default_ in the configuration above.

This means your content is visible again in _en\_US_, and you can start translating from _en\_US_ to _de_.

## Writing a custom ¬†migration

To create a node migration, place a new YAML file inside the _Migrations/ContentRepository_ folder of your package.

The name of the Migration YAML file must be _Version\[YYYYMMDDHHmmss\].yaml_, so the full timestamp (Year + Month + Day + Hour + Minute + Second) of the time when the migration is migrated is part of the filename, as in-order execution of migrations is sometimes important.

Here is an example of a migration that operates on nodes in the ‚Äúlive‚Äù workspace that are marked as removed and applies the RemoveNode transformation on them, i.e. deleting the nodes permanently.

Migrations/ContentRepository/Version20140708120530.yaml:
```yaml
up:
  comments: 'Delete removed nodes that were published to "live" workspace'
  warnings: 'There is no way of reverting this migration since the nodes will be deleted in the database.'
  migration:
    -
      filters:
        -
          type: 'IsRemoved'
          settings: []
        -
          type: 'Workspace'
          settings:
            workspaceName: 'live'
      transformations:
        -
          type: 'RemoveNode'
          settings: []

down:
  comments: 'No down migration available'
```

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:**
> 
> Node migrations in¬†Migrations/TYPO3CR¬†directories are also supported for historic reasons

> **üí° Pro tip:**

> Since Neos 8.3 it is possible to create node migrations also via the console. You can find more information in the documentation.

#### Available Filters

¬†The Content Repository comes with a number of filters:

*   DimensionValues
*   IsRemoved
*   NodeName
*   NodeType
*   PropertyNotEmpty
*   Workspace

They all implement the Neos\\ContentRepository\\Migration\\Filters\\FilterInterface. Custom filters can be developed against that interface as well, just use the fully qualified class name for those when specifying which filter to use.

[Browse the Node Migration Filter Reference](https://neos.readthedocs.io/en/stable/References/NodeMigrations.html#filters-reference)

#### Available Transformations

The Content Repository comes with a number of common transformations:

*   AddDimensions
*   AddNewProperty
*   ChangeNodeType
*   ChangePropertyValue
*   RemoveNode
*   RemoveProperty
*   RenameDimension
*   RenameNode
*   RenameProperty
*   SetDimensions
*   StripTagsOnProperty

They all implement the _Neos\\ContentRepository\\Migration\\Transformations\\TransformationInterface_. Custom transformations can be developed against that interface as well, just use the fully qualified class name for those when specifying which transformation to use.
