# Introduction

## What is Neos?
Neos is an open source content application platform. It offers a functional scope of a CMS (content management system),
but thanks to its flexible data model, also enables other possible uses, for example as a headless CMS.

Compared to other CMSs, Neos places great emphasis on intuitive usability 
and uses the website itself as an interface for editing wherever possible (inline editing).
This is intended to enable content editors to focus more on the content than on the editing technology.

Neos tries to satisfy the following target audiences:
- **Website visitors**: Rendered content with no additional JavaScript needed.
- **Content editors**: Full featured editing with inline editing.
- **Developers**: Stable and flexible framework, that allow the creation of amazing experiences.

## How does it work?
Neos is a PHP application which runs on a web server and an SQL database.
It is based on top of the [Flow Framework](https://flow.neos.io/){.secondary-link}, which is developed by the Neos team as well.

As a developer you configure the database via the structured content storage and define the rendering with an
object oriented templating language. For both the content and the rendering, you'll probably not need PHP â€“
but YAML and Fusion which serve as powerful abstractions.
