# Essentials

Neos is not just a content management system. It is based on the PHP framework "Flow", which allows to quickly create PHP web applications in combination with a powerful CMS. This makes Neos a full-fledged "Content Application Platform".

Neos and its ecosystem covers most of the common features needed for web content management. But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Neos is designed to be flexible and adoptable. Depending on your use case, Neos can be used in different ways.

If you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and guide only requires basic HTML and PHP knowledge, and you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.
