# Fusion

Fusion is a declarative templating language that is used together with [Eel expressions](/guide/rendering/eel).
While the syntax may look similar to JavaScript, it doesn't have a procedural character.
This means Fusion is more like [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), where you define your templates and partials and include
and iterate over them. Additionally, you can extend and granular override the templates.

The language itself is built around objects that define the rendering structure.
Every object prototype works differently; but you basically define keys-value properties of objects. 
The body of fusion objects is like an associative array. Certain objects have special properties that are predefined, e.g. 
the `renderer` property inside the `Fusion:Component` object. The current context is given to the The value of this property is returned to render the component.

#### Example
```php
prototype(MyComponent) < prototype(Fusion:Component) {
    myProp = 'value'
    renderer = ${'String: ' + props.myProp}
}
```

#### Preview

[String: value]{.preview}

### What is it?
::: info Content
More about how fusion works and a bit less about how fusion is integrated with the content repository, as this is already present in the essentials and in the following sub chapter
:::

::: danger The Fusion.Component "body" is a associated array.
This means, while it looks like other languages like JavaScript and you have control structures like _Collection_, "Case", "Map", "Loop" â€¦ you are not in a procedural context.

For every key and value:  
`key = 'value'`  
you create an entry in the associated array
