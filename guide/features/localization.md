# Localization

... & Internationalization

Whether you want to publish your content in multiple languages or for multiple countries, Neos has you covered. You can easily create translations from scratch, or based on existing content in other languages.

Complete localization covers a wide area. Things you might want to do:

*   Have editorial content in different languages by [defining multiple content dimensions](/guide/manual/content-repository/multiple-languages), or even for different countries with [Content Dimensions](/guide/manual/content-repository/content-dimensions).
*   Non-editorial text is translated using message catalogs in the [XLIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XLIFF) format. It allows you to translate text in your Fusion/Fluid/AFX files. The XLIFF format facilitates collaboration with external translation programs and services. [Learn more.](/guide/manual/rendering/translating-text-in-fusion)
*   Translate the Neos administration area for editors with different languages with [NodeType Translations](/guide/manual/content-repository/nodetype-translations). If you want to help the core Neos UI administration area, see [Contributing to Translations](/guide/contributing-to-neos/translations).
