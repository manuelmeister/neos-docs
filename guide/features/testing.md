# Testing

Neos is build with testing in mind 

## Behat tests for PHP

Our PHP code is tested with [Behat](http://behat.org/en/latest/), an open source [Behavior-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) framework for PHP. 

The Neos package contains a growing suite of Behat tests which you can take a look for inspirations on how to test your own code.
