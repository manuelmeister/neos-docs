> This page is not yet fully completed - we are still working on the content here. Expect some rough edges 🙃

The pages below here explain the technical details of the Event-Sourced Content Repository. **You do not need to know all this when** _**using**_ **the ES CR.**

This documentation is for people who want to **contribute** to the ES CR development - to ensure we all have the same view of concepts and ideas.

This documentation part was mainly created by Sebastian Kurfürst.
