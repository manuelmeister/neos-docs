# [Neos Developer Documentation]{.beta-badge}
Combining content and application {.lead}

::: warning Info
This is just a suggestion how the documentation could look like and how it should be structured to be more accessible for beginners and also advanced users.

Some content has already been added to the documentation. Sometimes it's just a placeholder or a description what should be the content for the section.
:::

[Get started](guide/introduction.md){.btn .mt-1}

::: info Writing style
A more advanced topic should only be linked to, if it requires no additional/prior knowledge (not contained on the linked topic).

e.g. On the introduction page, in a paragraph about rendering, no links should point directly to the Fusion Syntax page, just point to the rendering basics.
