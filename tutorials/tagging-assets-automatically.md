# Tagging assets automatically

Uploaded assets like images, documents or media files can be assigned to _Tags_ and _AssetCollections_ manually in the _Media_ module. Especially for sites with many assets it is useful to automate this in order to keep files organized.

#### Asset Collection based on site

Sites can already be assigned to an _AssetCollection_ in the _Sites Management_ module. If that is the case, any asset uploaded to a node within that site will automatically be added to the corresponding _AssetCollection_. This is especially useful in order to keep files of multi-site installations separated.

For more fine-granular manipulation the _ContentController::assetUploaded_ signal can be used to alter assets based on the node they were attached to:

#### Hooking into the asset creation

In order to hook into the asset creation, a new signal/slot connection has to be established. For this a new Package.php (usually in Packages/Site/The.Site/Classes/) has to be added:

_Example: Package.php_

```php
<?php
namespace Some\Package;

use Neos\Flow\Core\Bootstrap;
use Neos\Flow\Package\Package as BasePackage;
use Neos\Neos\Controller\Backend\ContentController;

class Package extends BasePackage
{
    public function boot(Bootstrap $bootstrap)
    {
        $dispatcher = $bootstrap->getSignalSlotDispatcher();
        $dispatcher->connect(ContentController::class, 'assetUploaded', AssetManipulator::class, 'manipulateAsset');
    }
}
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Note**
> 
> If you created a newÂ _Package.php_Â file you might need to runÂ _./flow flow:package:rescan_Â in order for Flow to pick it up!

The slot gets called with the following arguments:

*   The _Asset_ instance that is about to be persisted
*   The _NodeInterface_ instance the asset has been attached to
*   The node property name (_string_) the asset has been assigned to

So the signature of the slot method could look like this:

```php
function theSlot(Asset $asset, NodeInterface $node, string $propertyName)
```

This allows for manipulation of the asset based on the node property it has been assigned to.

### Example: Tagging employee images

Imagine you have a node type _Employee_ with the following setup:

```yaml
'Some.Package:Employee':
  superTypes:
    'Neos.Neos:Content': true
  ui:
    label: 'Employee'
    inspector:
      groups:
        'employee':
          label: 'Employee'
  properties:
    'image':
      type: 'Neos\Media\Domain\Model\ImageInterface'
      ui:
        label: 'Employee profile picture'
        reloadIfChanged: true
        inspector:
          group: 'employee'
          editorOptions:
            features:
              mediaBrowser: false
```

The following code would automatically tag this with the employee tag (if it exists):

_Example: AssetManipulator.php_

```php
<?php
namespace Some\Package;

use Neos\ContentRepository\Domain\Model\NodeInterface;
use Neos\Flow\Annotations as Flow;
use Neos\Media\Domain\Model\Asset;
use Neos\Media\Domain\Repository\TagRepository;

/**
 * @Flow\Scope("singleton")
 */
class AssetManipulator
{
    /**
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var TagRepository
     */
    protected $tagRepository;

    public function assignTag(Asset $asset, NodeInterface $node, string $propertyName)
    {
        if (!$node->getNodeType()->isOfType('Some.Package:Employee') || $propertyName !== 'image') {
            return;
        }
        $employeeTag = $this->tagRepository->findOneByLabel('employee');
        if ($employeeTag === null) {
            return;
        }
        $asset->addTag($employeeTag);
    }
}
```

_Example: AssetManipulator.php - if you want to assign the Asset to an AssetCollection_Â 

```php
<?php
namespace Some\Package;

use Neos\ContentRepository\Domain\Model\NodeInterface;
use Neos\Flow\Annotations as Flow;
use Neos\Media\Domain\Model\Asset;
use Neos\Media\Domain\Repository\AssetCollectionRepository;

/**
 * @Flow\Scope("singleton")
 */
class AssetManipulator
{
    /**
     * @Flow\Inject
     * @var AssetCollectionRepository
     */
    protected $assetCollectionRepository;

    public function assignToAssetCollection(Asset $asset, NodeInterface $node, string $propertyName)
    {
        if (!$node->getNodeType()->isOfType('Some.Package:Employee') || $propertyName !== 'image') {
            return;
        }
        $employeesAssetCollection = $this->assetCollectionRepository->findOneByTitle('employees');
        if ($employeesAssetCollection === null) {
            return;
        }
        $employeesAssetCollection->addAsset($asset);
        $this->assetCollectionRepository->update($employeesAssetCollection);
    }
}
```

Alternatively, the slot could also alter the _assetâ€™s title_ or _caption_.
